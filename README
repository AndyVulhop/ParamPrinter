Super simple sinatra app that prints all of the query string and post values on screen. Known issue:	If you have a param called "splat" it will be missed. This is a pretty odd edge case for most apps, so I'm not too worried about it. This is because the route uses a wildcard, which is put in a param called "splat". I removed it from the display, as it will usually be extraneous.	use:	/whateverYouWant/?var=value	The route is dynamic to support multiple urls based on environment or something like that. It's pretty specific to a single task I was working on.
